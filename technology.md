# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas is utilized to clean our Cuyahoga County voting data, while completing an exploratory analysis.

## Database Storage 
PgAdmin (SQL) is the database we intend to use, while integrating the data into Tableau for visual effects.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we will be using to create a classification model. Our training and testing
set up is 80/20. We will also possibly use a clustering model testing with voting age groups/districts
Using OnehotEncoding to determine party loyalty/switch

## Dashboard
In addition to using Tableau we will also use Google slides for our presentation. In addtion we plan to create
an application that will allow entry of Birth year and Zip code to predict voting pattern
