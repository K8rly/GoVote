# GoVote

## Selected Topic
Our topic will be: Registered Voter data for Cuyahoga County 


## Reason we selected this topic
Lately in the United States we have faced political turmoil at every turn. The state of our country and our democracy is at risk, emphasizing an importance to vote and secure a less grim future for our society. Our group feels that focusing on voter turnout by location and age is a relevant topic to examine and analyze because of our current climate. Voting prediction could be a valuable asset in the coming months, while identifying discrepancies in access to voting locations may paint an important picture. This topic has really captured our attention based on our country's unrest, and we intend to answer relevant questions based on a robust dataset.

## Description of source of data 
The Cuyahoga County Board of Elections website has many public datasets available. For this project we will utilize the countywide districts (registered voters) dataset. We have contacted the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections to assist with interpreting our dataset, and have chosen to use a government website as opposed to less credible source.
