### Selected topic
Analyzing voter registration in Cuyahoga County by Age and Precinct in order to determine trends in voting patterns and party affiliation

### Reason we selected the topic
The United States is experiencing high levels of political turmoil, making this topic extremely relevant. Our group would like to identify potential factors contributing to voting trends within our shared home county, and analyze voter data to relate generational identification to voting patterns. In analyzing this data we hope to predict which party affiliation groups are more likely to vote for based on demographic and geographic features.

### Description of the source of data
The Cuyahoga County Board of Elections serves its citizens by conducting the fundamental and vital functions of the election process. The Cuyahoga County Board of Elections has many datasets available to the public on their website [here](https://boe.cuyahogacounty.gov/maps-and-data). We chose to use a government site as opposed to a less credible source in order to ensure we are using clean and accurate data. 



### Questions we hope to answer with the data

What age group is more likely to vote? More likely to vote Republican or Democrat?

What precinct is more likely to vote? More likely to vote Republican or Democrat?


**Prediction: Which age groups/precincts are more likely to vote Republican or Democrat?
